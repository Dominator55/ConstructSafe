Welcome to my implementation of the ConstructSafe Inc. Powerplatform Exercise.

To read the documentation of the design and implementation and to learn more about me, please navigate to the project's [WIKI](https://github.com/Dominator55/ConstructSafe/wiki)

To successfully import the [main managed solution](https://github.com/Dominator55/ConstructSafe/blob/main/ConstructSafePoC_1_0_0_3_managed.zip), you must first install the [Custom Connector Solution](https://github.com/Dominator55/ConstructSafe/blob/main/ConstructSafeCustomConnector_1_0_0_1_managed.zip) so the connections can be established.

Thank you and enjoy.
