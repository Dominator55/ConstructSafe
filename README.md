Welcome to my implementation of the ConstructSafe Inc. Powerplatform Exercise.

To read the documentation of the design and implementation and to learn more about me, please navigate to the project's [WIKI](https://github.com/Dominator55/ConstructSafe/wiki)

To install this solution please go to the [Release1.0](https://github.com/Dominator55/ConstructSafe/releases/tag/Release1.0)

To successfully import the main managed solution, you must first install the Custom Connector Solution so the connections can be established.

Thank you and enjoy.
